My name is Andy Rittenhouse and I will be graduating this May from the University of Colorado,
Boulder, with a bachelors of science degree in computer science. Prior to my studies at CU
Boulder, I spent six years in the Air Force, where I guarded both nuclear weapons and the
President of the United States before receiving an honorable discharge at the rank of Staff
Sergeant. 

During my time at CU I have cultivated a deep knowledge of computer science fundamentals,
completing graduate level coursework in theoretical computer science, and serving as an
undergraduate Course Assistant for both Algorithms and Data Structures. I have taken coursework
in Data Science, Cybersecurity, Operating Systems, and Network Systems, and written clean,
modular code in a wide variety of languages: I have analyzed massive amounts of data with
Python, and built multi-threaded TCP proxy servers from scratch in C. 

In addition to my coursework, I also have real-world industry experience. Within my first week as
an intern at SARA, a defense contracting firm in Colorado Springs, I patched critical bugs in my
team's flagship product, and my code was quickly shipped to production. Additionally during my
time at SARA, I constructed an MS SQL-Server database from scratch, and wrote a Python program
to migrate a huge amount of data to this database from text files.

I am looking forward to joining the workforce full-time, where I am eager to continue developing
my skills as a software engineer.
