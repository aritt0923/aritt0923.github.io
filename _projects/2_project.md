CSCI 1300: Introduction to Computing was my first real programming class. We learned how to write in C++, and covered a wide range of introductory topics, from basic data structures, to pointers, to introductory OOP concepts. This program is written in C++ and makes use of the language's oject-oriented features. The program is neatly broken up into several maintainable files, and the code is organized into classes for clarity and modularity. 

Functionally, the program implements some basic features from the popular social media platform "Twitter". The user interacts with the program via the command line interface, and is able to create accounts, follow other users, and publish Tweets. The state of the program is saved to a file which can be read in the next time the program is run. I'm proud of this project - I had only been programming for a few months at the point I wrote this code, and the end result turned out pretty well.
